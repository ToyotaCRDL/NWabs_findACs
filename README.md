# Abstraction of chemical reaction networks and extraction of minimum autocatalytic cycles 

This repository implements a method to abstract chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and extract minimum autocatalytic cycles (MACs).

## Usage

Run `a_main_NWabs.m` contained in 'NWabs' for the abstraction of CRNs.

Run `a_main_findACs.m` contained in 'findACs' for the extraction of MACs.

## Requirements

Optimization Toolbox of MATLAB is needed for the extraction of MACs.
